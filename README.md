# Winraycast

Welcome to Winraycast, a modern refactoring of a classic 1990s ray-casting 3D engine, now revitalized for contemporary compilers. Crafted in C++, this project operates natively on Windows, eschewing reliance on external 3D libraries such as OpenGL or DirectX. At its core, Winraycast is an homage to the foundational era of 3D gaming and graphical computation, demonstrating the ray-casting algorithm in its purest form.

## Project Background

This endeavor is more than a simple codebase; it's a deep dive into the roots of 3D rendering techniques. Winraycast stands as a testament to the power and versatility of ray-casting in generating 3D environments. The project is directly inspired by and associated with an article originally published in the Computer Programming magazine by Infomedia ("Ray casting, engine 3d e videogame" by A. Calderone, first
published in Computer Programming, issue number 157 in May 2006.). You can delve into the article that started it all [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VdE1RofILJtZBS246gOk02VrHA-Tu_79/view).

## Winraycast in Action: Screenshots

We believe that seeing is believing. Here's a glimpse into the immersive world of Winraycast, where retro meets modern in a seamless blend of computational artistry. These screenshots showcase the engine's capabilities, from rendering intricate mazes to capturing the nostalgic essence of early 3D gaming.
